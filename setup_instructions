"pyvenv-3.4 venv" error:
As a stop-gap solution for n00bs like me, download the lib/ensurepip directory from the Python 3.4 source code, and place it in /usr/lib/python3.4 with the proper permissions.



GOOGLE API FOR PYYTHON3:
python3.4/site-packages/apiclient/base.py", line 4, in <module> from urllib import urlencode
changed "from urllib" to "from urllib.parse"

instead of apiclient, urllib3, and oauth2client, maybe this is better?
venv/bin/pip3.4 install --upgrade google-api-python-client

venv/bin/pip3 install git+https://github.com/enorvelle/GoogleApiPython3x.git
