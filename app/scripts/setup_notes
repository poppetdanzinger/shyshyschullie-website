install the unofficial python3 google api v3 library:
pip install git+https://github.com/enorvelle/GoogleApiPython3x.git

in that repo there are folders:
*apiclient
*oauth2client
*uritemplate
which must be in venv site packages.

also install python3-dateutil

run this the first time:
python3 setup_calendar.py --noauth_local_webserver 
this generates client_secrets.json, which should not be in your git commit
setup_calendar.py was originally "sample.py" in the package "calendar-cmd-line-sample"
